# 2.14 (Target Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor
# to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your doctors and trainers.
# According to the American Heart Association (AHA) (http://bit.ly/AHATargetHeartRates),
# the formula for calculating your maximum_sum heart rate in beats per minute is 220
# minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is 50–85% of your maximum_sum heart rate.
# Write a script that prompts for and inputs the user’s age and calculates and displays the
# user’s maximum_sum heart rate and the range of the user’s target heart rate. [These formulas
# are estimates provided by the AHA; maximum_sum and target heart rates may vary based on
# the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified
# healthcare professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]


age = int(input("Enter your age in numbers: "))
maximum_heart_rate = 220 - age
print("Your maximum_sum heart rate is " + str(maximum_heart_rate))
target_heart_rate = maximum_heart_rate // 5.0
print("Your target heart rate is in the range of " + str(target_heart_rate), end="--")
target_heart_rate = maximum_heart_rate // 8.5
print(str(target_heart_rate))
